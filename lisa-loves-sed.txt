#Here's a breakdown of what this script does:

#Set the input_file variable to the name of your large CSV file.
#Set the output_prefix variable to the prefix you want for the output CSV files.
#Set the lines_per_file variable to the number of lines you want in each output CSV file.
#Determine the total number of lines in the input CSV file using wc -l.
#Use a for loop to iterate through the input file in segments, defined by start and end line numbers.
#Inside the loop, use sed to extract the lines within the specified range and redirect the output to a new CSV file with a name based on the output_prefix, start, and end.
#You can adjust the lines_per_file variable to control the number of lines in each output CSV file. This script will create multiple output CSV files, each containing a portion of the data from the input file.
