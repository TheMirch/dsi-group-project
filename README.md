## Problem Statement
> Can statistically significant contributing factors to serious aviation accidents among Alaskan Bush Pilots be identified?

## Executive Summary
> This project seeks to analyze data related to aviation incidents involving single-engine aircraft in Alaska, with a focus on those leading to  fatalities. By understanding the primary factors contributing to these incidents, we hope to be able to contribute to recommendations for safety initiatives to further protect Alaskan aviators in the general aviation community.

> Our work for the Alaska Airmenâ€™s Association (AAA) is rooted in the goal of promoting effective emergency response and preventing fatal accidents. The AAA, a nonprofit established in 1951, is dedicated to promoting general aviation, enhancing safety, and supporting initiatives that benefit pilots. Our efforts aim to support their mission of advocating for access and safety infrastructure across the state. We seek to provide the AAA with our findings to support their advocation efforts in the upcoming 2024 calendar year.


## About Alaskan Bush Pilots
> Alaskan Bush Pilots are integral in communites throughout Alaska, demonstrating resilience and expertise while navigating the vast and rugged landscapes of Alaska. Often piloting single-engine light aircraft, these aviators must handle unpredictable weather conditions and challenging landing terrains. Their missions extend beyond conventional flight. They serve as the primary or only means of transportation for delivery and essential services to isolated communities. Additionally, Alaskan Bush Pilots play a vital role in search and rescue operations.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
Based on the key insights from our project, we can offer the following recommendations to the Alaska Airmen's Association, to address a spectrum of factors, ultimately improving aviation safety among Alaskan Bush Pilots:

### Weather Condition/ Visibility
> **Findings:**  
Our findings indicate that the effect of VMC conditions can lead to a 43.8% decrease in the odds of fatal injury in accidents compared to Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) all else held equal.

> **Recommendations:** 
> - Encourage members to seek and maintain their instrument
ratings.
> - Promote workshops and further resources related to
operating in IMC conditions.
> - Promote the use of weather forecasting and flight planning
tools.
> - Advocate for improvements in air traffic control procedures.

### Airport Proximity
> **Findings:**  
Our findings indicate that the effect of accidents occuring at or within 3 miles of an airport leads to an increase in odds of fatal injury by 11.1%.

> **Recommendations:** 
> - Promote the use of ground proximity warning systems
(GPWS).
> - Advocate for improvements to airport infrastructure and
runway conditions.
> - Work with airport authorities to develop and implement safety
procedures for low-altitude operations.

### Time of Day
> **Findings:**  
Our findings indicate that the effect of flying at night contributes to a 9.0% increase in fatal injury in accidents compared to flying in the morning, all else held equal.

> **Recommendations:** 
> - Promote workshops and resources on night flying safety.
> - Promote the use of night vision goggles (NVGs) and other
night flying equipment and training where applicable.

### General Recommendations:
> - Host workshops or seminars on fatal crash prevention.
> - Develop and distribute educational materials on fatal crash
risk factors.
