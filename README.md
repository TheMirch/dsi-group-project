### Problem Statement
> Can we identify significant contributing factors to serious aviation accidents among Alaskan Bush Pilots?

### Executive Summary
> This project seeks to analyze data related to aviation incidents involving single-engine aircraft in Alaska, with a focus on those leading to serious injuries or fatalities. By understanding the primary factors contributing to these incidents, we hope to develop targeted safety initiatives, enhance pilot training programs, and implement effective preventive measures. 

> Our collaboration with the Alaska Airmenâ€™s Association (AAA) is rooted in the goal of promoting effective emergency response and preventing accidents. The AAA, a nonprofit established in 1951, is dedicated to promoting general aviation, enhancing safety, and supporting initiatives that benefit pilots. Our joint efforts aim to make flying safer for Alaskan Bush Pilots and the communities they serve.


### About Alaskan Bush Pilots
> Alaskan Bush Pilots are essential contributors: demonstrating resilience and expertise while navigating the vast and rugged landscapes of Alaska. Often piloting single-engine light aircraft, these aviators must handle unpredictable weather conditions and challenging landing terrains. Their missions extend beyond conventional flight: they serve as the primary or only means of transportation for delivery and essential services to isolated communities. Additionally, Alaskan Bush Pilots play a vital role in search and rescue operations.

### Conclusions and Recommendations
> Based on the key insights from our project, we can offer the following key recommendations to to the AAA, to address a spectrum of factors, ultimately improving aviation safety among Alaskan Bush Pilots:

> **Weather Condition Awareness:**  Prioritize flying in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) whenever possible, to significantly reduce the risk of fatal injuries. Our findings indicate that flying in VMC conditions can lead to a 43.8% decrease in the odds of fatal injury compared to flying in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). Additionally, we suggest the AAA strongly encourages pilots to get and maintain their instrument ratings, and advocates for training and further resources on flying in IMC conditions. We also recommend promoting the use of weather forecasting and flight planning tools to improve weather condition awareness. 

> **Avoidance of Airport Proximity:**  Exercise caution when flying near airports, especially within a 3-mile radius. Our analysis reveals an 11.1% increase in the likelihood of fatal injuries occurring in such circumstances. Maintaining a safe distance from airports during flights can help mitigate this risk. We also advocate for improvements in air traffic control procedures for IMC conditions. Additionally, we recommend advocating for the utilization of ground proximity warning systems (GPWS), improvements in airport signage and lighting, and collaborative work with airport authorities to develop safety procedures for low-altitude operations. 

> **Time of Day Consideration:** Be mindful of the time of day when planning flights. Flying at nighttime carries a 9% higher risk of fatal injuries compared to morning flights. Where possible, adjusting flight schedules to minimize nighttime operations could contribute to a safer flying environment. Additionally, the AAA can encourage members to get and maintain their night flying proficiency, recommend training and resources on night flying safety, and promote the use of night vision goggles (NVGs) and other night flying equipment.


> **Other Safety Measures:** Hosting workshops or seminars on fatal crash prevention and creating educational materials on fatal crash risk factors will further contribute to fostering a safer flying environment for Alaskan Bush Pilots and the communities they serve.
